# LSB Audio Steganography 2

## About

LSB audio steganography is a common method of audio steganography consisting of hiding secret data into the least significant bit (LSB) of an audio file. In [lsbAudioSteganography](https://github.com/chengjingling/lsbAudioSteganography), the secret message was hidden at the beginning frames of the audio file. In this application, the secret message is hidden in random frames of the audio file, making it more complex to decipher the message.
